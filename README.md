# Slim Framework 4 Skeleton Application - AssisOfertasAPI
Slim is a PHP micro framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs. At its core, Slim is a dispatcher that receives an HTTP request, invokes an appropriate callback routine, and returns an HTTP response. Thatâ€™s it.

Slim is an ideal tool to create APIs that consume, repurpose, or publish data. Slim is also a great tool for rapid prototyping. Heck, you can even build full-featured web applications with user interfaces. More importantly, Slim is super fast and has very little code.

Configuration files:
* app/routes
* app/repositories
* app/settings

Project Source Files are inside _src_ folder

## Install the Application

Required PHP 7.3 or newer.

Run the following command to install the dependencies.

```bash
php composer.phar install
```

To run the application in development, you can run these commands 

```bash
php composer.phar start
```

After that, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.


That's it! Now go build something cool.

## Creating the database

First, in app/settings.php file you will find database standard settings. So, to get it simple, you have to create a database with the same name, user, password and collection type.


The actual database is small, but we need to figure out how to keep the code below updated:

```sql
CREATE TABLE promocao(
    id int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    produto varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    categoria int NOT NULL,
    fotoPromocao varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    dataIni DATETIME NOT NULL,
    dataFim DATETIME NOT NULL,
    ativa boolean DEFAULT TRUE
);

CREATE TABLE user(
    id int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email varchar(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    senha varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    nome varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
```
